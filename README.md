# Find-The-Way-Genetics

This project gives a simple example of how to solve a problem using the gentic algorithem.
In this case we have rectangles which try to reach a target while having multiple death zones on the way that kills them when they come in contact with.

## Dependencies

The script is running using python3.  
You can install the needed packages running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Output

At the start you will see basiclly random moves which will improve with time using the genetic algorithem.

### Gen 1

### Gen 700+
